In the initial blockchain demonstration, we've created a small problem. 
The mine endpoint is called on the server, which means we're the ones 
spending all of the electricity to generate a new block. This won't do at all!

Furthermore, the amount of work needed to actually mine a block is a bit low. 
We need it to be harder to preserve the integrity of the chain.
